üìå Project Overview
Retinal diseases such as Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Drusen are leading causes of vision loss. Manual diagnosis through OCT scans can be time-consuming and subjective. This project aims to automate the classification of OCT images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to support Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD).

üéØ Objectives
Build a CNN model to classify retinal images into four categories.

Improve diagnostic accuracy through advanced preprocessing and model optimization.

Deploy the model on a FastAPI-based web app hosted on AWS EC2 for real-time predictions.

üß† Technologies & Tools
Languages: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Modeling: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Deployment: FastAPI, Uvicorn, AWS EC2

Others: Model Checkpointing, Data Augmentation

üóÉÔ∏è Dataset
Source: Publicly available dataset containing OCT scan images of retina

Classes:

CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization)

DME (Diabetic Macular Edema)

Drusen

Normal

Total Images: ~80,000

Format: .jpeg images labeled in separate directories per class

üß™ Model Development Pipeline
1. Data Ingestion
Loaded images from four folders, each representing a disease class

Resized all images to 224x224 for uniform input shape

2. Data Preprocessing
Normalization

Data Augmentation: Rotation, Flip, Zoom, Shift

Splitting into train, validation, and test sets

3. Model Architecture
Constructed a CNN using Keras, consisting of:

Convolutional + MaxPooling layers

Dropout for regularization

Fully connected dense layers

Softmax output for multi-class classification

4. Training & Evaluation
Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Metrics: Accuracy

Implemented ModelCheckpoint callback to save best-performing model

Achieved ~88% validation accuracy

5. Deployment
Built a REST API using FastAPI

Deployed the application on AWS EC2

Supports image upload and returns real-time disease classification
